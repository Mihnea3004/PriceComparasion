# PriceComparasion
This project focuses on developing a robust application designed to provide users with comprehensive pricing information for selected products. The application will allow users to input the name or details of a product they are interested in, and it will search across multiple sources to find and return the lowest available price for that item. Additionally, the application will display a direct link to the seller or retailer offering the best price, making it convenient for users to complete their purchase. To enhance transparency and aid decision-making, the application will also include a detailed price history chart, illustrating the evolution of the product's cost over time, helping users identify trends and make more informed purchasing decisions.
